El viaje prometía ser tranquilo, de modo que tanto Pyerce como Pym insistieron a su capitán que siguiera descansando y les dejara a ellos encargarse de llegar a su destino, pues habiendo derrotado al Valrock, se había merecido el descanso tras haber luchado solo en tan ardua batalla contra el monstruo más magestuoso de todos los mares.\n","\n","Pyratilla al principio se opuso, pues sentía que era su deber estar despierto y atento en caso de que apareciera otro enemigo, pero luego pensó que realmente no es que se lo mereciera sino que necesitaba dicho descanso. De este modo, dejó a sus tripulantes encargados de llegar a Isla Torva, pero en caso de necesidad, les ordenó que lo avisaran.\n","\n","Y así fue como Pyratilla se encerró en su camarote, se metió bajo las sábanas y se quedó frito.\n","\n","---\n","\n","Pyratilla despertó, pero no lo hizo en su camarote. Lo último que recordaba era haberse metido en la cama con la intención de descansar mientras su tripulación se encargaba de llegar a su destino: Isla Torva. Por tanto, no conseguía entender como había llegado a la habitación blanca en la que se encontraba.\n","\n","Miró a su alrededor y lo único que veía era su cama sobre la cuál estaba tendido y un escritorio de madera pegado a una de las 4 paredes. Observó que no había ni puertas ni ventanas. La luz provenía de una lámpara del techo.\n","\n","Se frotó los ojos una y otra vez e incluso se pellizco varias veces la mano hasta dejársela roja para ver si estaba soñando. Parecía que no, pues siempre que abría los ojos volvía a ver la cama, el escritorio y la lámpara. Decidió levantarse y ver más de cerca ese bonito escritorio de madera.\n","\n","Al levantarse de la cama logró ver que sobre el escritorio había 2 hojas de papel escritas. Se acercó rápidamente para leer las palabras negras que destacaban sobre el fondo blanco. En la primera hoja podía leerse \"Vamos a jugar a un juego. Las reglas son sencillas: sigue las instrucciones que aparecerán en la otra hoja y conseguirás salir de aquí. En total hay 10 pruebas que debes superar numeradas del 1 al 10. Si las respondes todas correctamente, abrirás una salida. En caso contrario... no.\"\n","\n","Sorprendido y un poco asustado observó la otra hoja. En ella solamente se leía: \"Carga el csv llamado `characters-hp` en una variable llamada `hp_df`\".\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AoMLjjxaOLlf"},"source":["¡Ayuda a Pyratilla a cargar el csv (que previamente debes haber guardado en tu carpeta de Google Drive) en la variable `hp_df`!\n","\n","PISTA: A la hora de cargar el dataset con el método que creas conveniente, vas a tener que configurar dos parámetros: el parámetro `sep` tiene que estar igualado a `\";\"`, y el parámetro `encoding` debe estar igualado a `\"Windows-1252\"`.

Usa el método `.query()` para obtener únicamente las observaciones cuyo valor de la variable `Job` es `Student` y guarda este dataframe filtrado en la variable `hp_students`\n","7. Fíjate que los nombres de las filas del dataframe `hp_students` siguen siendo los originales. Renombra las filas para que vayan del 1 al número total de observaciones que haya en `hp_students`.

Se trata de que sustituyas el original por una lista que contega como entradas los números que van del 1 al número total de observaciones que tiene el dataframe `hp_students`\n","8. ¿Qué proporción de estudiantes hay? La proporción se calcula como el número de estudiantes entre el número total de observaciones.\n","9. ¿Cuál es el valor de `Hair colour` para la observación 30 de `hp_students`? Calcúlalo usando el método `.loc[]`\n","10. Obtén la cantidad de colores diferentes que hay para la variable `Eye colour` en el dataframe `hp_students`.
